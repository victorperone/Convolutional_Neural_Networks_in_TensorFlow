This repository documents my implementation and analysis of convolutional neural network architectures built throughout the Coursera course **Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow**.

It covers CNN fundamentals, robust image classification pipelines, data augmentation strategies, and transfer learning techniques using TensorFlow and Keras.

## 🎯 Focus of This Repository

Rather than simply completing course exercises, this repository emphasizes:

- Architectural reasoning
- Loss-function alignment
- Overfitting diagnostics
- Data augmentation strategies
- Transfer learning implementation

## 📘 Course Overview

This course, which is the second of the DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Specialization, focuses on advanced techniques for improving the computer vision models developed in [Course 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow). It covers working with real-world images of different shapes and sizes, visualizing an image's journey through convolutions to understand how a computer _"sees"_ information, trace loss and accuracy, and explore strategies to avoid overfitting, including boosting and dropping. Finally, it introduces transfer learning and how learned features can be extracted and reused across models.

Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning and Deep Learning Specialization courses provide a strong foundation in the core principles of machine learning and deep learning. Building on this foundation, the DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Specialization emphasizes the practical implementation of these principles using TensorFlow, enabling learners to design and deploy scalable models for real-world applications.

This course is recommended after completing [Introduction to TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow).

My work for that course is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/victorperone/Introduction_to_TensorFlow_for_Artificial_Intelligence).

### **Course Modules**

## 💡 Why This Matters

Understanding CNN architecture design, overfitting behavior, and transfer learning is foundational for:
- Medical imaging
- Autonomous systems
- Visual inspection systems
- Large-scale image classification platforms

## 🛠️ Key Concepts Mastered

| Concept | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Data Augmentation** | Artificially expanding datasets by rotating, zooming, and shifting images to prevent overfitting. |
| **Transfer Learning** | Leveraging pre-trained models (like InceptionV3) to solve tasks with limited data. |
| **Dropout** | A regularization technique to force network redundancy and robustness. |
| **Softmax & Crossentropy Alignment** | Designed multi-class classifiers using proper loss–activation pairing and label encoding strategies. |
